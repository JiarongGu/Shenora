# Mobile shells — what a second and third target actually cost

The mobile shell runs on Android and iOS — shipped as `Shenora.Android` + `Shenora.iOS` from one
shared source tree — and needed **no `#if` anywhere** to do it. That
is the good news and it is also the trap: because the C# ports for free, every real cost lands
somewhere else — in the PAGE, on the BUILD HOST, or in the device harness. This rule is those costs.
Earned across the Android port and the iOS port (both 2026-08-02).

## The rules

- **Write the page for the SUPERSET of shells, never the one you tested on.** Identical markup looked
  correct on an Android emulator for a whole session and put its heading under the status bar and the
  Dynamic Island on the first iPhone run. An emulator has no safe-area insets to violate, so the bug
  cannot appear there. Use `env(safe-area-inset-*)` with `viewport-fit=cover` — both collapse to
  nothing where there are no insets, so it costs the desktop shell zero. The same law covers strings:
  a shared bundle means `hello from android` eventually appears in an iPhone screenshot.
- **The runtime identifier must match the TARGET, and the failure always names the wrong step.** Twice
  in the same shape now: `android-x64` against an arm64-only build fails at INSTALL with
  `INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS`, and `iossimulator-x64` against `-arm64` fails the same way. The
  BUILD succeeds both times, so the error reads as packaging rather than architecture. Ask the target
  what it is (`dev.mjs mac` reads the Mac's `uname -m` over ssh); never assume the dev machine matches.
- **Prove it on the device, and say which half you proved.** A shell that compiles is not a shell that
  runs; `dev.mjs android` and `dev.mjs mac` exist so a claim about either can carry a screenshot.
- **A webview on both shells does NOT mean the auxiliary-SESSION stack ports (D39).** `StreamingSession`
  and friends rest on CDP (screencast, device metrics, OS-level input replay), which neither shell
  exposes in-process — iOS has no CDP at all. The trap is that a port IS buildable behind the same
  interface (frame-polling + `evaluateJavaScript` synthetic DOM events) and is materially weaker:
  polled, and `isTrusted: false`, which is exactly what the pages that stack exists for reject. Nothing
  needs stubbing, because the stack is in `Shenora.Windows` and portable logic cannot name it. Read D39
  before writing any of it — the sanctioned mobile answer per intent is there.

## Gotchas / traps

- **A device-log command must FILTER BEFORE IT TAILS.** Written down for Android (`logcat -t N`
  applies `-t` to the RAW buffer, so a filterspec after it prints nothing) — and then rebuilt from
  scratch in the iOS harness, where a process-wide predicate is ~99% WebKit lifecycle chatter and
  `tail -n` showed a screen of noise with none of the app's lines. Both look exactly like a broken log
  sink. **The meta-lesson is why this bullet exists: a rule written about one harness does not protect
  the next harness you write in a different file.** Adding a second device loop? Re-read the first
  one's traps deliberately.
- **A build artifact does not travel with `git push`.** `dist/` is gitignored, so a remote build host
  has no `@shenora/react` and the sample silently falls back to its hand-written inline transport —
  running, looking correct, and proving less than the run it is being compared against. Build the
  client package ON the build host, and make the page SAY which transport it used.
- **iOS pairs the workload to an exact Xcode, and clearing that takes two flags.**
  `ValidateXcodeVersion=false` clears the up-front gate (an EQUALITY check on major.minor — a NEWER
  Xcode is refused too); `MtouchLink=SdkOnly` clears MT0180 from the ILLink **Setup** step, which
  independently wants the SDK headers Xcode ships. `PublishTrimmed=false` is rejected outright and
  `MtouchLink=None` still fails MT0180 — do not retry either. Simulator-debug only; matching the pair
  is the real fix. Machine-specific, so it belongs in gitignored config, never a tracked csproj.
- **"iOS needs a Mac" is TRUE OF AN APP AND FALSE OF A LIBRARY, and the difference cost a whole
  release design.** A `net10.0-ios` library builds anywhere the `maui-ios` workload is installed —
  Windows included — because compiling C# against `Microsoft.iOS` reference assemblies needs no Xcode.
  Only producing an `.app` bundle and running it does; the MSBuild target that enforces the Xcode
  pairing (`_ValidateXcodeVersion`) is conditioned on `_CanOutputAppBundle`. Believing otherwise
  produced a three-job macOS release pipeline, drafted in full, for a problem that did not exist —
  deleted unbuilt when someone asked "does it actually need that?". **Both mobile packages build and
  are gated on Windows.** Check which artifact a platform constraint applies to before designing
  around it.
- **Signing does not work over ssh** — an ssh login is a different AUDIT SESSION, so a login-keychain
  key fails `errSecInternalComponent`. Simulator builds sign ad-hoc and are unaffected; a device build
  needs the Terminal.app hand-off.
- **`Application.Current` is null inside `CreateMauiApp`** (`builder.Build()` makes the MauiApp, not
  the Application) — use `Dispatcher.GetForCurrentThread()`. And the page MUST load the platform's own
  bridge script or `window.HybridWebView` never exists, the page renders fine, and the host sits
  waiting for a handshake that cannot arrive.
